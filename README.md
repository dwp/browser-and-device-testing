**Functional support** : user should be able to complete a journey - some enhancements such as HTML5 may be not supported or provide graceful degraded user experience.

**IE7/8 supports** : generally speaking these browsers have low percentage in terms of users - however it might be worth looking at other services to get an idea of what the traffic is like across similar services.

**Firefox and Chrome**: these would be tested on a single version of Windows and Mac.
